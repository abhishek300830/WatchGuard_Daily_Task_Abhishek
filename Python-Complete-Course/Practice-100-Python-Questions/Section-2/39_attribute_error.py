#  The script is supposed to output the cosine of angle 1 radian, but instead, 
# it is throwing an error. Please fix the code so that it prints out the expected output.

import math

print(math.cos(1))

print(dir(math))


#  You could get a list of all available methods of the math module with dir(math) 
# and see whether cosine is there or not
